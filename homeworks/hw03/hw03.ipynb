    "Welcome to Homework 3! In this homework, you will practice core DataFrame methods introduced in Lectures 5 and 6 – grouping, merging, and pivoting, in particular. See the [Readings section of the Resources tab on the course website](https://practicaldsc.org/resources/#readings) for supplemental resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given six slip days throughout the semester to extend deadlines. See the [Syllabus](https://practicaldsc.org/syllabus) for more details. With the exception of using slip days, late work will not be accepted unless you have made special arrangements with your instructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access this notebook, you'll need to clone our [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/practicaldsc/fa24/). The [⚙️ Environment Setup](https://practicaldsc.org/env-setup) page on the course website walks you through the necessary steps. Once you're done, you'll submit your completed notebook to Gradescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please start early and submit often. You can submit as many times as you'd like to Gradescope, and we'll grade your **most recent** submission. Remember that the public `grader.check` tests in your notebook are not comprehensive, and that your work will also be graded on hidden test cases on Gradescope after the submission deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework is worth a total of **54 points**, 45 of which come from the autograder, **and 9 of which are manually graded by us** (Questions 1.3, 6.1, and 6.2). The number of points each question is worth is listed at the start of each question. **The four parts of the assignment are independent, so feel free to move around if you get stuck**. Tip: if you're using Jupyter Lab, you can see a Table of Contents for the notebook by going to View > Table of Contents.\n",

You should always also assume that `df` has at least one row.\n",

    "If you answered Question 2.3 correctly, you'll see above that in 2016, the Democratic `'party'` won the most votes of any `'party'`, with 48.5\\% of the total vote. But, the Democratic `'party'` **did not** actually win the 2016 presidential election – the Republican `'party'` did.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this is the Electoral College, which is explained in sufficient detail in the [article that was linked before](https://kz.usembassy.gov/summary-of-the-u-s-presidential-election-process/). In short, there are 538 Electoral College votes total, and each `'state'` (plus Washington D.C., which is treated like a `'state'` for the purposes of the Electoral College) is assigned some number of Electoral College votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `'candidate'` that wins the most votes in a particular `'state'` wins **all** of the Electoral College votes assigned to that `'state'`*. For example, in 2020, the Democratic `'party'` only won 50.6% of the vote in Michigan, but because this was more than any other `'party'` won in Michigan, the Democratic `'party'` took all 16 Electoral College votes assigned to Michigan.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in the 2016 election, even though the Democratic `'party'` won more votes overall – i.e. they won the \"popular vote\" – they won fewer Electoral College votes, and so they lost the election to the Republicans. To win the election, a `'party'` needs to win at least 270 of the 538 Electoral College votes. (Why 270? $\\frac{538}{2} = 269$, so if both `'party'`s won 269 votes, there would be a tie.)\n",
    "\n",
    "_*Caveat: This is not exactly how the Electoral College works in Nebraska and New Hampshire, but for simplicity, we will assume that these two `'state'`s work the same way as all other `'state'`s, in that they give all of their Electoral College votes to the `'candidate'` that won the most votes in their `'state'`._\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the cell below to load in a DataFrame, `ec`, which contains the number of Electoral College votes assigned to each `'state'` in 2020. (Note that the number of Electoral College votes assigned to each `'state'` changes every 10 years, when the US conducts the Census. The number of Electoral College votes per `'state'` is different in 2024 than it was in 2020.)"

    "- Your plot must have the abbreviation of each `'state'` plotted on top of the `'state'`, along with the number of Electoral College votes assigned to that `'state'` in 2020. Use the `figure` `.add_scattergeo` method to do this after you create the rest of your choropleth; you'll find examples online of how this works.\n",

    "    - To prevent the map from getting too crowded, we hid the annotations for New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Washington D.C., Maryland, and Delaware; you don't have to do this, but it's a good idea.<br><br>\n",
    "- Your plot must use one color for the Democratic `'party'` and one color for the Republican `'party'`. The colors you choose do not matter, except for the fact that **you cannot use the default colors that `px.choropleth` uses**. (If you want to use the politically accurate colors, as we did above, the Republicans use red and the Democrats use blue.) You'll need to either read the documentation or do some Googling to figure out how to change colors for different categories, but as a hint, these can be set using an argument to `px.choropleth` (i.e. you don't need to use `fig.update_layout`).<br><br>\n",
    "- **Question 3.3 has no hidden tests, so as long as you pass the public tests here, you'll receive full credit for it.** Everything that isn't mentioned above but is in our example plot (e.g. a text color of white instead of black, or a different font) is optional – but make your plot as pretty as you can!\n",

Recall from [Lecture 6](https://practicaldsc.org/resources/lectures/lec06/lec06-filled.html#Pivot-tables-using-the-pivot_table-method), a pivot table allows you to aggregate the entries in a DataFrame based on two categorical columns. If it helps, [here](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.09-pivot-tables.html) is another great resource that provides an overview of `pivot_table` with many examples from the Titanic dataset."
