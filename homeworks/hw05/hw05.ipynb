Obsessed with discovering the cause of generation and life and bestowing animation upon lifeless matter, Frankenstein assembles Mary Shelley began writing Frankenstein when she was only eighteen. At once a Gothic thriller, a passionate romance, and a cautionary tale about the dangers of science, Frankenstein tells the story of committed science student Victor Frankenstein. Obsessed with discovering the cause of generation and life and bestowing animation upon lifeless matter, Frankenstein assembles a human being from stolen body parts but; upon bringing it to life, he recoils in horror at the creature's hideousness. Tormented by isolation and loneliness, the once-innocent creature turns to evil and unleashes a campaign of murderous revenge against his creator, Frankenstein.Frankenstein, an instant bestseller and an important ancestor of both the horror and science fiction genres, not only tells a terrifying story, but also raises profound, disturbing questions about the very nature of life and the place of humankind within the cosmos: What does it mean to be human? What responsibilities do we have to each other? How far can we go in tampering with Nature? In our age, filled with news of organ donation genetic engineering, and bio-terrorism, these questions are more relevant than ever. ...more\",\n",

    "\n",
    "You're aspiring for a finance job in Chicago, and decide to put your new data wrangling skills to the test by pulling stock data from an API and calculating various statistics. The API we will work in this question is hosted by Financial Modeling Prep, and can be found at https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#daily-chart-charts. Specifically, we will use the \"**Daily Chart EOD**\" endpoint – search for it at the linked page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some relevant definitions:\n",
    "- Ticker: A short code that refers to a stock. For example, Apple's ticker is AAPL and Ford's ticker is F. \n",
    "- Open: The price of a stock at the beginning of a trading day.\n",
    "- Close: The price of a stock at the end of a trading day.\n",
    "- Volume: The total number of shares traded in a day.\n",
    "- Percent change: The difference in price with respect to the original price, as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make requests to the aforementioned API, you will need an API key. **In order to get one, you will need to make an account at the website.** Once you've signed up, you can use the API key that comes with the free plan. It has a limit of 250 requests per day, which should be more than enough. You will have to encode your API key in the URL that you make requests to; see a complete example of such a request at the [**documentation**](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#Stock-Historical-Price)."

    "- Read the API [**documentation**](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#Stock-Historical-Price) if you get stuck! In particular, [this page](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/playground?url=daily-chart-charts) will help you craft the URL you need to make a request to.\n",
    "- To format the starting and ending dates you'll need to pass to the API, [`pd.date_range`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.date_range.html) might be helpful, along with `pd.to_datetime`.\n",
    "- The [`requests.get`](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/) function returns a Response object, not the data itself. Use the `json` method on the Response object to extract the relevant JSON, as we did in [Lecture 10](https://practicaldsc.org/resources/lectures/lec10/lec10-filled.html#APIs-and-JSON) (you don't need to `import json` to do this).\n",
    "- You can instantiate a DataFrame using a sequence of dictionaries as input to `pd.DataFrame`. Once you've gotten your response object back, you're done 99% of the work involved with this question."
