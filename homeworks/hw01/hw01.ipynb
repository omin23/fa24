    "Welcome to Homework 1! In this homework, you will practice with core features of the Python language, including defining functions, writing conditional statements and loops, and working with lists and strings. You'll also gain experience in reading documentation to figure out how to work with unfamiliar libraries. See the [Readings section of the Resources tab on the course website](https://practicaldsc.org/resources/#readings) for supplemental resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given six slip days throughout the semester to extend deadlines. See the [Syllabus](https://practicaldsc.org/syllabus) for more details. With the exception of using slip days, late work will not be accepted unless you have made special arrangements with your instructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access this notebook, you'll need to clone our [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/practicaldsc/fa24/). The [⚙️ Environment Setup](https://practicaldsc.org/env-setup) page on the course website walks you through the necessary steps. Once you're done, you'll submit your completed notebook to Gradescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please start early and submit often. You can submit as many times as you'd like to Gradescope, and we'll take your **most recent** submission. Remember that the public `grader.check` tests in your notebook are not comprehensive, and that your work will also be graded on hidden test cases on Gradescope after the submission deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework is worth a total of **40 points**. The number of points each question is worth is listed at the start of each question. **The four parts of the assignment are independent**; with the exception of Part 1, in which the questions build off one another, you can complete the questions in any order. Tip: if you're using Jupyter Lab, you can see a Table of Contents for the notebook by going to View > Table of Contents.\n",

    "The United States, like many countries, uses a progressive tax bracket system. This means that as your earnings increase, the percentage of your earnings you owe in tax also increases.

    "- The notation $(a, b]$ means \"greater than $a$ and less than or equal to $b$\". For example, someone with a taxable income of \\\\$44,725 is in the 12% bracket, but someone with a taxable income of \\\\$44,725.01 is in the 22% bracket. For simplicity, we will only test your code on integer values of taxable income.\n",
    "- \"Taxable income\" refers to the part of one's income that is taxable; in the US there is what's known as a \"standard deduction\" which can be thought of as a discount on your taxes. Here, we won't worry about deductions.\n",

    "The video above describes the [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture), which says the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pick a positive integer `n` as the start.\n",
    "2. If `n` is even, divide it by 2.\n",
    "3. If `n` is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.\n",
    "4. Continue this process until `n` is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number `n` will travel up and down but eventually end at 1 (at least for all numbers that have ever been tried – nobody has ever proved that the sequence will terminate). Analogously, a hailstone travels up and down in the atmosphere before eventually landing on earth, which is why this sequence is sometimes called the **hailstone sequence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we start with $n = 10$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$10 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 16 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, **for $n = 10$, we'd say the hailstone sequence is of length 7.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the implementation of the function `hailstone`, which takes in a positive integer `n`, **prints** out the hailstone sequence starting at `n` (including `n` and `1`), and **returns** the **length** of the sequence. Example behavior is given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In  [5]: hailstone(10)\n",
    "         10\n",
    "         5\n",
    "         16\n",
    "         8\n",
    "         4\n",
    "         2\n",
    "         1\n",
    "Out [5]: 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the `[5]` above is arbitrary; what's meant to be highlighted is the fact that the numbers 10, 5, 16, ..., 1 are being printed, but the value of `hailstone(10)` is `7`.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Hint***: You'll need to write the kind of loop that we **didn't** write in [Lecture 2](https://practicaldsc.org/resources/lectures/lec02/lec02.html). It's a good idea to write out the hailstone sequence for an arbitrary number by hand on paper to make sure you understand how it works."
